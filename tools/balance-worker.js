// costs energy (BUMP, times the animal's bump), and while the chaser is after it a second bump before it has fallen back
// (RECOVER, DAY_RECOVER) is caught; it eats 4 in 5 of the food and the golden food (POWER_SECS without losing energy, the
// chaser falling back). The same course every time (as in the game), the misses at random (TRIALS runs, the same random
// numbers for every miss rate, so a higher one never does better).
