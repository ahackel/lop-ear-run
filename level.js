// The course an animal runs: what comes (the day's land's obstacles, see LANDS; branches, crows; food, golden food), where, and how fast
// the world goes there. It depends on the animal and on how far the run is, nothing else: the same animal's run looks
// the same every time, whatever the player does (bumps, super powers, the chase at night change how fast it goes by,
// not what comes). Each piece of the course has its own random numbers (seeded by the animal and its number), so one
// that comes out differently (the sly fox finds more food) changes nothing after it.
//
// It gets harder all the way, with no top: faster, closer together, more crows, branches and packs, less food, more
// tiring (hardness: days run, in steps of a day and a night, and a head start for each animal after the rabbit, on top
// of its own dials in art.js). Whatever comes can be got past: the gap before an obstacle leaves room to land from
// the jump before it (or stand up from a duck) and jump, duck or stay low in time, at the speed of a night's chase
// (see fair; tools/test.mjs checks it by playing every course through).
