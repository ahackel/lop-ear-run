# Lop Hop

A little endless runner: a lop-eared rabbit hops over bushes, cacti, rocks and logs, ducks under branches and crows, and eats to keep its energy up. Every bump costs energy; with none left, it is knocked out (birds circle its head). A run is a day and a night (DAY and NIGHT in big letters as they come), each animal in a land of its own, with obstacles of its own (the meadow: bushes and sunflowers; the desert: cacti and tumbleweeds; the forest: toadstools, pines and stumps; the mountains: rocks and boulders; the canyon: red rock spires; the snow: snowmen, snowy pines and ice; then round again), and it gets harder as it goes: faster, closer obstacles, more crows, branches and packs, less food, more tiring. An animal's course is the same every run (what comes and where), and every obstacle can be got past: there is always room to land and jump, duck or stand up in time. A jump pressed just before landing jumps as the animal lands; one pressed while ducking does nothing (let go of the duck first). Food eaten one after another is worth more (25, 50, 75, 100), until a bump or a missed one. Food eaten with the energy almost full (more than there is room for) is a treat too (an animal has at most 5): it flies into the bag by the energy bar, is brought home at dawn (a knock-out loses them all), and on the title the picked animal's treats are over it, with their count (it begs for them now and then), to be dragged to it: it reaches for one in tries, standing up on its hind legs for one held high (the elephant reaches with its trunk), bending down for one held low; let go at its mouth it is eaten, elsewhere it drops (caught as it passes the mouth, or the animal walks to where it lies and eats it there), hearts float up. At night the next animal chases it, closer with every bump; a second bump while it is close and it catches the animal. Toward the night's end the sky pales and the sun comes up, and at dawn the run ends, home (HOME!, worth 100): the world comes to a stop and the animal runs off to the right, back to the title, and the first time the chaser, unlocked, runs up to the middle of the screen and stays there (on the title, where the animals stand in a row from right to left, the first on the right, it runs in from the left and stops behind the others): twenty-one in all, the rabbit the easy start, each after it a little harder (faster, hungrier, bumps cost more, crows sooner, obstacles closer and in packs, and a head start on the run's hardness) and worth more points (×1 to ×4). Four are special (the cheetah, the gorilla, the elephant, and the dino, last): they never chase, the animal before one is chased by the one after it; one comes on a full-moon night: once every animal before it is unlocked, every third run is one (the full moon on the title says the next run is), and it chases instead of the usual animal, faster; getting home from it, it joins. On the title, the animal that would chase the one picked, not unlocked yet, stands behind it as a shadow. Now and then golden food floats high over an obstacle: catching it gives a super power for 8 seconds, each animal its own. Every animal has a song of its own: the game's song in its key, mode and pace, with its own voices and a motif of its own (the same three recordings). One table of ten high scores, kept in the browser: the animal, name, score. Every run is written down, for balancing the game (see the balance page below). Everything, the buttons and the high scores too, is drawn in the game's own low-res pixels. In English or German (the device's language).

| Animal | Food | Power |
|---|---|---|
| rabbit (×1) | carrot | super hop: higher, and once more in the air |
| guinea pig (×1.1) | cucumber | popcorn: hops by itself over everything (and for joy), ducks under what hangs low |
| cat (×1.21) | fish | nine lives: bounces off what it hits |
| dog (×1.43) | bone | zoomies: faster, bowls everything over |
| pig (×1.53) | truffle | truffle snout: what is just ahead is dug up as truffles, to eat on the way |
| cheetah ★ (×1.64) | drumstick | sprint: very fast, and untouchable |
| fox (×1.86) | grapes | sly fox: food comes to it, the chaser loses its trail |
| hedgehog (×2.07) | apple | spike ball: rolls through everything |
| squirrel (×2.29) | acorn | glide: falls slowly, jumps again in the air |
| otter (×2.5) | shell | belly slide: under what hangs low, through the rest |
| skunk (×2.71) | beetle | stink: obstacles fade (it runs through them), crows and the chaser flee |
| gorilla ★ (×2.93) | fig | chest drum: ducking drums instead, and the next obstacle is knocked over |
| wolf (×3.14) | sausage | howl: what is just ahead is blown away |
| boar (×3.21) | mushroom | tusk charge: faster, smashes everything (worth double) |
| bear (×3.29) | blueberries | berry rush: double points, food fills it twice as much |
| yak (×3.36) | hay | stampede: a herd runs by again and again, trampling what is ahead; the chaser flees |
| ostrich (×3.46) | melon | fly: keeps flying, its wings beating, while the jump is held |
| elephant ★ (×3.57) | peanut | splash: sprays water from its raised trunk, what is just ahead is washed away |
| dromedary (×3.68) | date | spit: knocks crows and branches away |
| rhino (×3.79) | leaf | quake: stomps, everything on the screen flies off |
| dino ★ (×4) | roast leg | giant dino: twice as big, it tramples everything in its way, for double points |

**Play: https://andreashackel.de/lop-hop/** — on a computer, or on a phone held sideways. Add it to the home screen (Share → Add to Home Screen on an iPhone, Install app on Android) and it runs full screen, offline too (online, it always loads the latest version).

| | Keyboard | Touch |
|---|---|---|
| jump (hold to jump higher) | <kbd>Space</kbd> / <kbd>↑</kbd> | tap the right half |
| duck | <kbd>↓</kbd> | hold the left half |
| pick an animal | <kbd>←</kbd> <kbd>→</kbd> on the title | tap it on the title |
| sound, high scores, credits, full screen | <kbd>M</kbd>, <kbd>H</kbd>, <kbd>C</kbd>, <kbd>F</kbd> | the buttons at the top left of the game |

The music is [Stardrift](https://github.com/ahackel/stardrift-engine), a procedural chiptune engine for games: the song (`song.zip`: the song and the recordings it plays, as the editor's *Export for a game* writes it) has a mood for each state of play and stingers for its events, and the page shows the calls as the game makes them (with `?music`, on a computer; `?auto` lets the animal run by itself, to hear the moods come and go):

| Game | Music |
|---|---|
| title | `setMood('menu')` |
| high scores | `setMood('highscore')` |
| knocked out, home | `setMood('relaxed')` |
| the first stretch, crows from 300, fast from 700 | `exploring`, `tension`, `action` |
| night falls (after the day's 1000) | `wonder` |
| the next animal gives chase (through the night) | `danger` |
| a super power (golden food, 8 s) | `power`, with `sting('power')` and `sting('powerdown')` |
| a run starts, a jump, food, a bump, a smash | `sting('go')`, `jump`, `reward`, `bump`, `smash` |
| night falls, and the chaser comes | `sting('dusk')`, `chased` |
| home, at dawn (the chaser unlocked, the first time: `discovery`) | `sting('escape')` |
| past the best score so far | `sting('record')` |
| knocked out (into the high scores) | `sting('alert')` (`fanfare`; home: the same) |

## Working on it

Plain files, no build step: GitHub Pages serves the repo as it is.

```bash
npm run dev        # http://localhost:8323 (the audio needs http://, not file://)
npm test           # the song plays every mood and stinger; every animal is tall enough to hit a branch and ducks under it;
                   # every course is the same every run and can be got past (played through, six days); it gets harder
                   # every day and with every animal; nothing newer than Safari 15 without a fallback
node tools/course.mjs  # the courses, day by day: how fast, how close, food against tiredness, where energy runs out
npm run engine     # copies the engine from ../stardrift-engine into engine/ (or: node tools/engine.mjs <path>)
npm run icons      # draws icons/ (and the iOS app's icon) from the game's own pixel art
npm run rigs       # writes every animal's build the way the workshop saves it
```

Once per checkout, `git config core.hooksPath tools/hooks`: at each commit the hook writes `version.js` (when the build
was made, and which engine it plays), which the credits screen shows.

In the address: `?reset` starts the game over as the first time (nothing unlocked, no high scores, no treats; the runs written down for balancing kept, `?reset=all`: them too), `?lang=de` (or `=en`) plays it in that language (otherwise: the device's, if there is a file for it, else English), `?music` shows the music's moods and calls under the game, `?all` opens every animal for a visit, `?treats` gives every animal all the treats it can have (5) for a visit (`?treats=2`: 2), `?auto` runs by itself, `?fps` shows the frames a second and the
work of a frame (on average and at most, in ms: a frame has 16.7 at 60) and the canvas's size, and since the start the
frames that took other than a 60th of a second's steps (UNEVEN) and those over 50 ms while running (LONG), `?scale=3`
draws the game 3 screen pixels an art pixel (fewer than the screen has: the page scales it up), `?hz=120` draws up to 120
frames a second where the browser gives that many (not in Safari on an iPhone or iPad, nor in the iOS app: 60 there),
`?log` writes each frame that came late or early, or took long, to the console with what happened just before it (in the
iOS app: Xcode's console; a debugger attached holds up a frame now and then, so smoothness is judged with the app opened
from the home screen).

The animals are edited in the workshop: with `npm run dev` running, open http://localhost:8323/tools/workshop.html.
Drag the handles on the joints, shapes, legs, tails and ears, pick colors and layers in the list, watch the animal run in
the game's scene, and save: it writes the animal's build back into its file. Its moves are on a timeline, with the frames
before and after faded: a jump, hurt or knocked-out pose can be set by hand (drag the joints, paws, head, tail and ears of
each keyframe), a run or a crawl tuned by its gait's settings. In the game, an animal eases from one move into the next
and squashes as it lands.

The balance is tuned on the balance page (http://localhost:8323/tools/balance.html, with `npm run dev`): every animal's
dials (speed, jump, drain, meals, …) and the numbers all the animals share, each with a slider, and what they come to,
worked out by the game's own code: how hard it is to get the next animal (how often a player can run into something
and still get home at dawn, away from it, half the time; and the chance, missing 1 in 33, 17 or 8), how many days
a player who never misses lasts (eating all the food, or 4 in 5), the score that reaches, how fast it goes, how much
warning an obstacle gives. The ladder shows all twenty-one in a row, each
meant to be harder than the one before (one that is not is marked), and what was there before behind it. The changes
are kept in the browser, not yet written to the files. Under the ladder, your runs: for each animal how many, how long,
how often it got home, the tries it took to get the next one, how often a jump or a duck
was missed, how much food was eaten, how runs ended. The game writes every run down; played from the dev server (on this computer, or
an iPad in the house at http://<this computer>.local:8323) they come in by themselves (`data/runs.jsonl`), from the
app they are shared from the credits (SHARE: AirDrop, Mail, Files…) and dropped onto the balance page.

| `index.html` | the page: only the game, on every screen (`?music` on a computer: the music's moods and calls under it) |
| `game.js` | the game: input, the run, energy, its buttons, the high scores, the calls to the music |

| `level.js` | the course: what comes where (the same every run, for an animal), how fast, how it gets harder, why it is fair |
| `art.js` | the pixel art, drawn from shapes: the rigs that draw the animals, obstacles, food, a 3×5 font (with Ä Ö Ü) |
| `lang.js`, `lang/` | what the game writes, in English and German: a file per language, a line each, `id = words`, written as usual (the game writes them in capitals); `npm test` checks every language has every id, the same `{name}` holes, only letters the font has, and lines that fit. A new language: a file with the ids of `en.txt`, its code in `LANGS` (`lang.js`), the file in `sw.js`, and the language in the Xcode project (`knownRegions`, Info.plist `CFBundleLocalizations`: an app reports only the languages it declares) |
| `animals/` | an animal each: its build (joints, shapes, legs, chains, face: the data the workshop edits) and its moves; `kit.js`: what they share |
| `tools/workshop.html` | the animal workshop (through `npm run dev`, which saves for it) |
| `tools/balance.html` | the balance page: the animals' dials and the shared numbers, how hard each animal is (`balance-worker.js` works it out with `course.mjs`), and your runs |
| `data/runs.jsonl` | the runs played from the dev server, a line each (not in git) |
| `version.js` | when the build was made, and its engine (written at each commit, `tools/version.mjs`) |
| `song.zip` | the music: the song and its recordings, loaded as it is (`music.loadZip`); a new version comes from the [editor](https://github.com/ahackel/stardrift)'s *Export for a game*, saved over it |
| `engine/` | a copy of the Stardrift engine's code (`engine/VERSION` says which commit; its recordings come in `song.zip`); `npm run engine` refreshes it |
| `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, `icons/` | the installable app: offline files, name, icons, landscape |
| `app/` | the iOS app (Capacitor): `npm install` and `npm run sync` there copy the game's files into `www/` and the Xcode project (`ios/`), `npm run open` opens it in Xcode |
