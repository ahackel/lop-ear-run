// What the four-legged rigs share (see the cat, and the rigs in art.js), worked out from a rig's own build: standing,
// the gallop, jumping, lying low (the crawl, knocked out on its back) and an idle that breathes and looks about. Places
// are in the 26×20 box, the feet on row 19; a leg's length is its thigh and shin.
//
// An animal's file holds its build (between `// @build` and `// @end`: the data the workshop edits and writes back) and
// its make: the build with its moves (poses). A build:
//   fur          its color (a palette name: see NAMED in art.js), as every color is
//   joints       hip, chest, head: places in the box. The spine runs from the hip to the chest
//   torso        r (how thick), ends (how far past the hip and the chest), capsule (round ends): along the spine; r 0: none
//   shapes       the body: ellipse [x, y, rx, ry], capsule [ax, ay, bx, by, r], box [x0, y0, x1, y1, r] or triangle
//                [[x, y] × 3], `on` a joint (in its frame: spine, hip, chest turn with the spine; head with the head) or in
//                the box; joined smoothly (smooth: how much), outlined, and what collisions test
//   paint        markings: shapes in a color, only on the body
//   top          shapes drawn over the body, outlined (horns, fangs): { color, shapes }; no collisions
//   dots         single pixels: { on, at, color }
//   spikes       a shape where the body bristles (speck: a color for specks inside)
//   socks        a color for the lower legs
//   legs         each: on (hip or chest), at (where it joins), thigh, shin, r, far (behind the body), bend (1: the knee
//                back, -1: forward), foot [rx, ry] (a flat foot)
//   chains       swung by the body's motion: a tail (on, at, angle from straight up, more: further back; links, length, r
//                or [r at the root, r at the tip], curl per link, +: forward; color, marks [[t along it, color, r]], end (a
//                round end), front (drawn over the body)) or a pointed ear (ear: its base [[x, y] × 2] on the head, tip).
//                stiffness pulls each link to its rest, damping stops it ringing, weight pulls it down
//   face         eye, nose (in the head's frame), noseColor
//   recolor      { name: name }: colors swapped everywhere (the wolf: a grey fox)
